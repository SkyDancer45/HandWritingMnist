**Title:** MNIST Handwritten Digit Recognition with TensorFlow in Jupyter Notebook

**Description:**

This Jupyter Notebook demonstrates a deep learning approach to recognizing handwritten digits using the MNIST dataset and TensorFlow. It achieves an accuracy of approximately 99%, showcasing the effectiveness of neural networks for image classification tasks.

**Getting Started:**

1. **Prerequisites:**
   - Python 3 ([https://www.python.org/downloads/](https://www.python.org/downloads/))
   - Jupyter Notebook ([https://jupyter.org/](https://jupyter.org/))
   - TensorFlow ([https://www.tensorflow.org/install](https://www.tensorflow.org/install))
   - NumPy ([https://numpy.org/](https://numpy.org/))
   - Matplotlib ([https://matplotlib.org/](https://matplotlib.org/))
   - scikit-learn ([https://scikit-learn.org/stable/](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/)) (optional, for accuracy calculation)

2. **Installation:**
   Install the required libraries using pip (assuming Python 3):

   ```bash
   pip install tensorflow numpy matplotlib scikit-learn
   ```

3. **Running the Notebook:**
   - Launch Jupyter Notebook:
     ```bash
     jupyter notebook
     ```
   - Open this notebook (`MNIST_Handwritten_Digit_Recognition.ipynb`) in your browser.
   - Run the code cells sequentially (top to bottom) by clicking the "Run" button (usually a play icon) or pressing `Shift+Enter`.

**Explanation:**

- **Imports:** The notebook imports necessary libraries like TensorFlow, Keras (part of TensorFlow), NumPy for numerical operations, and Matplotlib for visualization.
- **Data Loading:** The `keras.datasets.mnist.load_data()` function loads the MNIST dataset, splitting it into training and testing sets for images and labels.
- **Data Preprocessing:**
   - The training and testing images are normalized (divided by 255) to bring pixel values between 0 and 1, which can improve training performance for neural networks.
   - Consider exploring other preprocessing techniques like image resizing or data augmentation if needed.
- **Model Building:**
   - A sequential neural network model is created using `Sequential` from Keras.
   - A `Flatten` layer is used to reshape the 2D image data into a 1D vector suitable for the following dense layers.
   - Two dense layers with 32 and 128 neurons, respectively, are added for feature extraction using rectified linear unit (ReLU) activation functions.
   - A final dense layer with 10 neurons (one for each digit class) uses the softmax activation function to predict the probability distribution of class labels.
- **Model Compilation:**
   - The model is compiled using `model.compile()`, specifying:
     - Loss function: 'sparse_categorical_crossentropy' (suitable for multi-class classification).
     - Optimizer: 'Adam' (a popular optimization algorithm).
     - Metrics: ['accuracy'] to track training and validation accuracy.
- **Model Training:**
   - The model is trained using `model.fit()`, fitting it on the training data (`X_train` and `y_train`) for 10 epochs (iterations over the entire dataset).
   - `validation_split=0.2` allocates 20% of the training data for validation, allowing the model to learn better by preventing overfitting.
- **Evaluation:**
   - After training, the model's performance is evaluated on the unseen test data using `model.predict()`.
   - The predicted labels are obtained by taking the argmax (index of the maximum value) along the axis of probabilities for each data point.
   - The accuracy score is calculated using scikit-learn's `accuracy_score()` function (optional), providing a measure of how well the model generalizes to unseen data.
- **Visualization (optional):**
   - The notebook might include a visualization of the training and validation loss and accuracy curves using Matplotlib's `plot()` function. This can help diagnose overfitting or underfitting issues.
